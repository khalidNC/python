We are going to create a new project let's name it pyyelp. This project sends http request to Yelp api to get list of business. The full process of the project will be documented here breaking down step by step:

1. Create a new project:
                        a. Open the terminal
                        b. And create a root diectory: Terminal command: mkdir pyyelp
                        c. Open the directory in VScode: Terminal command: code .
                        d. Make a source directory under root directory: name it for example, src
                        e. Then create a py file inside src directory named e.g app.py

2. Virtual environment & Install packages:
                        a. Open terminal in vscode
                        b. Install request package: Terminal command: pipenv install requests
                           This will create a virtual environment as well as install the package.
                           And the Pipfile and lock file are created.  
                        c. Then change the virtual environment for the pyyelp project in vscode.
                        d. At this point if vscode suggets to install linter pylint then go ahead and install it
                        
3. Starting codding:
                        a. Go to app.py file
                        b. Import request package
                        c. Then use get method to get data. The code will be like:
                            import requests

                            requests.get()
                        f. Here we need to pass a str "url" the url is the address of the endpoint. To get the
                           yelp site on fusion api doc page: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-intro
                           here you find business search endpoint: https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search
                           just copy this address and pass as parameter in get method. So the code comes like,

                           import requests

                           requests.get("https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search")

                        g. This get method returns a response object. We created a variable called response. So the
                           code is now: response = requests.get("https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search")

                        h. At this point, vscode may suggest to install code formatter for this virtual environment
                           so let's install it.
                        i. Now pirnt the response. The code now looks like:

                            import requests

                            response = requests.get("https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search")

                            print(response)

4. Run the code output:
                        a. Now save the chnages and run the code
                        b. OutPut: <Response [401]>

5. Authentication:
                        a. The 401 is the status of one of the standard http error codes.
                        b. If you search the 401 in google you see this error indicates unauthorized request. In
                           this case, we got this error because we did not tell yelp who we are. So every time we want to call any of the endpoints of Yelp we need to send the key to tell Yelp who we are. This is we call authentication. 
                        c. Now back to the Yelp developer portal: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/
                           And get started the dcumentation: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs
                           Then go to fusion authentication in left menu: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication
                        d. This page is telling us that first we need to create app to get the api key. We already
                          did this(See yelpapi file).
