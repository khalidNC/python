''' We already come to know about Python library. Even though this library is very 
comprehensive it does not have everything we potentially need to build a real application. 
There are times we need the feature that not implemented in python standard library. 

That's where Python Package Index, in short PyPi comes in the picture. PyPi is like npm or
nodejs packages in javascript. 

PyPi is a repository of software packages for the Python programming language. It serves as a 
centralized hub where Python developers can publish and share their libraries, modules, and 
applications, making them easily accessible to the Python community. PyPI is a crucial component 
of the Python ecosystem, as it simplifies the process of distributing, installing, and managing 
Python packages.

Key features and functions of the Python Package Index (PyPI) include:
Package Hosting: 
PyPI hosts a vast collection of Python packages, which can be easily searched and downloaded.

Package Management: 
Python package management tools, such as pip (Python's package installer), interact with PyPI to fetch 
and install packages. Developers can use pip to install packages with a single command.

Version Control: 
PyPI allows developers to upload multiple versions of their packages. This is important for maintaining 
compatibility and supporting different versions of a package.

Metadata: 
Each package hosted on PyPI includes metadata like the package name, version, description, author 
information, dependencies, and more. This metadata helps users understand what a package does and 
whether it's suitable for their needs.

Open Source: 
PyPI encourages the distribution of open-source Python packages, making it a valuable resource for 
both open-source and proprietary projects.

Community and Collaboration: 
Developers can contribute to open-source packages on PyPI by submitting patches or updates, and they 
can report issues or request new features.

To use PyPI and its packages, you typically use the pip package manager, which can install, upgrade, 
and uninstall Python packages directly from PyPI. 

For example, you can install a package from PyPI like this:

pip install package_name

PyPI is a fundamental part of the Python ecosystem, and it has significantly contributed to the 
ease of Python package distribution and installation, fostering collaboration and innovation in 
the Python community. '''
