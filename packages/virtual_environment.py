''' A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory that houses a Python interpreter 
and its own set of libraries. It is used to isolate and manage Python packages and dependencies 
for different projects, ensuring that one project's dependencies do not interfere with another. 
Virtual environments are particularly useful when you have multiple Python projects with different 
library requirements.

Here's a explanation with an example of how to create and use virtual environments in Python: '''

''' 1. Creating a Virtual Environment:

You can create a virtual environment using the venv module (for Python 3.3 and later) or virtualenv 
(an external package).

Using venv: 
python -m venv myenv 

Using virtualenv (if not installed, you can install it via pip):
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv

Replace myenv with the name you want to give to your virtual environment. '''
