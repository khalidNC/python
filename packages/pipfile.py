''' When we install a packagess useing pipenv 2 files are automatically created, Pipfile and Pipfile.lock these
2 files are use to keep track of the dependencies of our project 

For example; we open the Pipfile then we see basicallay below thigns;
The primary purpose of a Pipfile is to specify the dependencies for your Python project. It lists all the packages 
and their versions required for your project to run correctly. These dependencies are typically stored under two 
sections: [packages] and [dev-packages].

[packages]: This section contains the main project dependencies required for the application to function in production.
[dev-packages]: This section contains dependencies required for development, such as testing frameworks, linters, 
or tools used during development. '''
