''' The class is extremly important in Python or programming in general.
Let's have some examples: '''

# We are defining a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2]
# Then when we use dot notation we can see set of methods for the list
numbers.clear()
print(numbers)

# Now if we create objects like;
shopping_cart = []
shopping_cart.add()
shopping_cart.remove()
shopping_cart.get_total()
