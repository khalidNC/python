20th Step Adding the Homepage:

1. Introduction:
So far we ahve done the admin site, movies index, and movie detail page however our homepage is still broken. When we head over to this address: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ it redirects to page not found. So now we will add a template for homepage and render this.

2. Steps of Creating Homepage:
    a. Add views.py module in the main app
    b. Define view fuction in the module
        1. The function takes a request
        2. and render a template and return it
        3. So we need to import render function from django shortcuts module
        4. so we return render() function that takes requst as 1st argument, and template as 2nd argument
        4. Note: since we do not render any data in the homepage so we will not pass context object 
    c. Map the view fucntion to a url endpoint
        1. Back to urls module in vidjan app
        2. Import the views module that we just created in vidjan app
        3. Create a new url pattern, basically add a new path object, and pass empty string to represent the homepage
        4. and map this to the class reference that we just created in views module
    d. Create html template
        1. There are two places where we can create html template
            a. Add template inside vidjan folder. In this case we need register the divjan as an app in setting.py module. Also we need a config class in apps.py(need to create this as well under vidjan) module to register as an app.
            b. Put all the general templates like, homepage, about page, contact page and so on inside mani template folder
        2. In this case, we will choose second option
        3. Add a html template file inside template folder
  
3. Steps breakdown with codes:
    a. Add views.py module in the main app:
        1. Go to vidjan folder
        2. Add a new file named views.py
    b. Define a view function called home
        1. The function takes request
        2. This function retunrs the results of the render function which takes the request, and html template

        Codes:
                from django.shortcuts import render

                def home(request):
                  return render(request, "home.html")

    c. Map the home fucntion to a url endpoint
        1. Back to urls module in vidjan app
        2. Import the views module that we just created in vidjan app:
            Codes: from . views import Home
        3. Create a new url pattern, basically add a new path object, and pass empty string to represent the homepage
        4. and map this to the class reference that we just created in views module

            Codes:
                    urlpatterns = [
                        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
                        path('movies/', include('movies.urls')),
                        path('api/', include(movie_resource.urls)),
                        path('', views.home)
                    ]

    d. Create html template
        1. There are two places where we can create html template
            a. Add template inside vidjan folder. In this case we need register the divjan as an app in setting.py module. Also we need a config class in apps.py(need to create this as well under vidjan) module to register as an app.
            b. Put all the general templates like, homepage, about page, contact page and so on inside mani template folder
        2. In this case, we will choose second option
        3. Add a html template file inside template folder in root:
            a. Add template named home.html inside template in root directory
            b. Open the file extends base.html
            c. Add block and specify it as content 
            d. Inside the block add body tag with a basic style
            e. Inside body, add a paragraph inside <p> tag
            f. Inside p tag add a anchor tag with specify the url rendering dinaymicly and the text to be linked. 

                Codes:
                        {% extends "base.html" %}

                        {% block content %}
                          <body style="--bs-body-color: #0e0e0e;">
                            <p>
