''' Command line arguments allow you to pass input parameters to your Python scripts when 
they are executed from the command line. Python provides the argparse library as part of 
the standard library to easily handle command line arguments. The argparse library simplifies 
the process of defining and parsing command line arguments, making it a powerful tool for 
creating flexible and user-friendly command line interfaces for your Python programs. '''
