''' So far we use the Python built in functions. Now we will see how create
a custom function.
First we need to difing the function as "def"
Then we need to give a name of the function like variable.
Function name should be meaningful, lowercase and words separated by underscore.
Then a parenthesis and end with colons.
Then it makes a auto endentation that means the following statements are belong to the function.
Now the function is and we need to call it as we call the built-in function. 
We need to remove the indentation and add 2 lines break after the function.
Which is pep8(Python style guide) requirments. '''
