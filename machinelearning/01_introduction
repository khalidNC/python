Machine learning:
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit programming. The primary goal of machine learning is to allow computers to learn and improve from experience.

There are three main types of machine learning:

Supervised Learning: This involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the algorithm learns to map input data to corresponding output labels. The model makes predictions or classifications based on this training and is evaluated on its accuracy.

Unsupervised Learning: In this type of learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find patterns, relationships, or structures within the data without explicit guidance. Common unsupervised learning techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Reinforcement Learning: This involves training a model to make decisions by providing feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The model learns to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time. It is often used in scenarios where an agent interacts with an environment.
